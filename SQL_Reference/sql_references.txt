Basic definition of an SQL Database

	* SQL -> Means ( Structured Query Language );

	* it is a query language to access and modify the database ( records are stores here );

	* it is an query language not an database;

	* it is designed for maintaining the relational database management system

	* it is based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus

SQl Syntax :

	* SQl is not an case sensitive ( KEYWORDS are written in Uppercase )

	* End With Semi colon ( ; ) it is mainky used for seperate the SQL Statements

SQl Keywords :
	
	* SELECT - it extract the data from the database;
	* UPDATE - it update the existind data;
	* DELETE - it will delete the existiog record;
	* CREATE TABLE - creates the table;
	* AlTER TABLE - alter ther table;
	* DROP TABLE - deletes the whole table;
	* CREATE DATABASE - create the new database;
	* ALTER DATABASE - modify the database;
	* INSERT INTO - insert new data into database;
	* CREATE INDEX - it creates an index like search keys;
	* DROP INDEX - it deletes an index;

SQL Date Types : 

	SQl String Data types : 

		* CHAR - its size can be 0 to 255
		* VARCHAR - the size can be from 0 to 65535
		* BINARY - it stores the binary byte string like CHAR
		* VARBINARY - it stores the binary byte string like VARCHAR
		* TEXT - it contains the maxlength of 255 charecters
		* TINYTEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, LONGTEXT - this is same as TEXT but storage capacity will be differ
		* ENUM -
		* SET - it is used to specify the string that have 0 or more values
		* BLOB - it stores large amount of data ( upto 64MB )

	SQL Int Data types :

		* BIT - it is used for bit valiue types;
		* INT - it is used to store the integer values;
		* INTEGER - it is same as INT;
		* FLOAT(size,d) - d -> it refers the number of decimal points;
		* FLOAT(p) - p -> it will used to specify the weather it is a float or decimal;
		* DOUBLE(size, d) - d - refers total number of precisioins after the decimal;
		* DECIMAL(size,d) - length of an d is upto 30, it is a fixed point number;
		* DEC(size,d) - it is same as decimal type;
		* BOOL - it is used to specify the boolean type like ( TRUE, FALSE );

	Sql Time stamp : 

		* DATE - it is used to specify the date format YYYY-MM_DD
		* DATETIME(FSP) - it is used to specify the date and time format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
		* TIMESTAMP(fsp) - it is used to specify the timestamp its value is stored in seconds 		it is format is same as the DATETIME format
		* TIME(fsp) - it is used to specify the time format its format is hh:mm:ss
		* YEAR - it is used to specify the four digit it allows 1901 to 2155 and 0000

SQL Operators :
	
	* it have three types 
		* Arithmetic
		* Comparision
		* Logical

			* Arithmetic operators :
				
				* ( +, -, *, /, % ) - modulo returns reminder
			* Comparision operators :
				
				* ( =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, !<, !> )
				* < > - not equal it returns true if values are not matched
			* Logical operators : 

				* ALL - it is used to compare the all values with anathor set of values
				* AND - it is used to check multiple conditions in the sql statements
				* ANY - it is used to compare the value in the list according to the condtion
				* BETWEEN - it is used to search the value between the two or more values
				* IN - it is used to compare a value in specified list(weather present | not)
				* NOT - not operator is always used to reverse an logical operator
				* OR - it is used to combine multiple condtions in a sql statemets
				* EXISTS - it is used to search a presence of row in the specied table
				* LIKE - it is used to find the similar value using operators
