HTML -> HYPEER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE;

it is not a programming language;

it is an markup language that tells the browser to how to structure the content(web page);

it is consistes of ELEMENTS;

ELEMENT : 
	
	* element is a combination of opening tag and closing tag and the content;

	* example : 
		
			 ----Contant----
		* <p> This is a cat </p> 
		  -------Element--------

		* <p> 	-> Opening Tag;
		* </p> 	-> Closing Tag;

NESTED ELEMETNS : 
	
	* Putting the Element inside an element is called Nesting Element;

	* The first opening Tag should be closed very last;

BLOCK VS INLINE ELEMENTS :
	
	BLOCK LEVEL : 
		
		* this is basically shows the content in new line;

		* it is basically a structural Element;

		* example list, navigation menu, or footer, 

		* we cannot nest the block level elements inside the inline elements;

	INLINE :

		* This are contained inside the block level elements;

		* It used in small part of the content;

		* It is not cause the new line;

		* it is mainly used in "Text formatting" and "Text Elements";

Empty Elements : 

	* Sometimes some TAGS are not have closing tag this kind of elements are called EMPTY ELEMENTS;

	* Mainly these are used to insert/embed something inside the content;

	* it is also called as "VOID Elements"

	* Example : img,embed, and Etc....

ATTRIBUTES :
	
	* Elements also have some attributes also;

	* it contains the extra info about the element but it is not visible in the content;

	* example :

		* <p class="paragraph">Element with attribute</p>

	* Each attribute should have between them;

	* Attribute name followed by equal sign;

	* Attribute value should be wrapped with opening and closing tags;

	* Attribute without value is acceptable;

	* using multiple attributes for anchor tag : 

		* <a>-> opening tag

		* href -> attribute 1

		* title -> attribute 2

		* target -> attribute 3

		* content -> content

		* </a> -> closing tag

BOOLEAN ATTRIBUTES :
	
	* Attribute without value is called Boolean Attributes;

	* it have only one value;

	* it is generally same as attribute name;

	* Example : disabled property -> it disables the form input fileds;

	* Example :

		* <input disabled="disabled" />

OMITTING THE QUATES :

	* <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/>favorite website</a>

	* Example : The Element HREF is not using the Quates to Wrap the elemwnt;

	* but some attribute should have quate to wrap the value;

	* it is nessessery;

	* Example : title = "Title of the page"; (Correct Way) takes the entire string to display;

				title = Title of the page;(In correct way) it takes the "Title" to display;

SINGLE vs DOUBLE QUATES:
	
	* we can use the single and double quate to wrap the element;

	* but it have some limitations;

		* <p class="paragraph'></p> -> "INVALID";

		* <p class='paragraph"></p> -> "INVALID";

		* <p class='paragraph's'></p> -> "INVALID";

		* same for Double Quates;

ANATOMY of an HTML Element:

	* induvidual HTML Element are not useful for Develop web page;

	* 	<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		  	<head>
		    	<meta charset="utf-8">
		    	<title>My test page</title>
		  	</head>
		  	<body>
		    	<p>This is my page</p>
		  	</body>
		</html>

	* <!DOCTYPE html> -> Doctype is an historical artifact that needs to be included for everything this is an shortest string that count as a valid doctype ;

	* <html></html> -> it is the root element that wraps the whole content of the page;

	* <head></head> -> this is an comtainer element; it is helpful to include anything to our html douument. it is not shown as a content. some example like CSS JAVASCRIPT Files, Keywords;

	* <meta charset="utf=8"> -> this will helps us to add charecter set of an HTML document;

	* <title></title> -> which will helps to set a title of an page; which is an title apperars in the browser tab; itis helpful at the time of adding the bookmark;

	* <body></body> -> this element will contains all the content to show to the user; like images, text, videos and games and more;

WHITE SPACES IN HTML :
	
	* if we use the multiple white spaces for the beautiful alignment;

	* HTML won't care about that spaces, The HTML parser will reduce the each lonf spaces into the single;

	* For example :

		* <p>Dogs are silly.</p>

		* <p>Dogs        are
         			silly.</p>
    * in this example the both the element will be prints the same content with same spaces

SOME USEFUL CHAR REFERENCES :
	
	* 	<	&lt;
	*	>	&gt;
	*	"	&quot;
	*	'	&apos;
	*	&	&amp;

For ADDING the Comments :
