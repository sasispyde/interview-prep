			<h1><strong>Re : Eileen Dover University Application</strong></h1>
			<p>Dear Eileen,</p>
			<p>Thank you for youtr recent application to join us at the University of Awasome science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your question one by one in the following section.</p>
			<section>
				<h2><strong>Starting dates</strong></h2>
				<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one of the follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Frist semester : <date value="9 September 2016">9 September 2016</date></li>
					<li>Second semester : <date value="15 Janaury 2017">15 Janaury 2017</date></li>
					<li>Third semester : <date value="2 May 2017">2 May 2017</date></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

				<h2>Subjects of study</h2>
				<p>At the Awasome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research faculty - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science of technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have our team.Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we ware most intrigued by are the follows, in order of priority:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
					<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>&deg;</sup>C(86<sup>&deg;</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10 <sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10 <sup>4</sup>.)</li>
					<li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subject, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
